//! The connector driver contract.

//! A driver knows how to talk to one flavour of source host (GitLab, GitHub,
//! …). It is deliberately narrow: authenticate, enumerate repositories,
//! produce a clone URL. Everything tenant-shaped — which connections exist,
//! who may see them, where the token is kept — belongs to the connector
//! service, not here, so adding a provider stays a small, local job.
