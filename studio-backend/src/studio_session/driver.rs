//! Session driver abstraction (ADR-0003).
//!
//! [`SessionService`](super::service::SessionService) owns everything that is
//! independent of *how* a session container runs — validation, the workspace
//! manifest, the in-memory registry, tenant isolation, credstore-resolved
//! tokens, the reaper. A [`SessionDriver`] owns the one thing that is not:
//! launching, probing, destroying, and re-adopting the actual runtime.
//!
//! The Docker driver ([`super::docker::DockerDriver`]) is the MVP: one
//! container per workspace on the local daemon, published on a loopback port.
//! The Kubernetes driver is its successor: one Pod+Service per session behind
//! the backend's authenticated proxy. Both satisfy this trait, so the REST
//! surface and the portal flow do not change with the backend.
