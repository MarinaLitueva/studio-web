//! studio-project — projects as a first-class record.
//!
//! ## Why this is a gear and not Resource Group metadata
//!
//! ADR-0002 put Projects on RG groups and called a dedicated gear "Step 3, only
//! if logic outgrows CRUD". It has. A project now has two mutually exclusive
//! shapes (start from an idea vs. start from existing code), a journey-stage
//! selection with a mandatory member, a status ladder that only moves forward,
//! and a name that has to be unique inside its workspace. RG's
//! `metadata_schema` can express the first two — it is a JSON Schema and RG
//! really does validate group metadata against it — but not the last two: there
//! is no unique index over group metadata and no transition hook.
//!
//! ## What stayed on Resource Group
//!
//! Membership. ADR-0002 explicitly allows it ("Project membership can stay on
//! RG"), and RG already carries memberships, closure tables and their
//! authorization; reimplementing that here would be the expensive half. Each
//! project gets an RG group of type `cf.studio.project.v1~` and remembers its
//! id. The gear also registers that RG type at start, which retires the manual
//! `demo/setup-projects.sh` step.
//!
//! ## What stayed on file-storage
//!
//! Bytes. An uploaded codebase goes to the file-storage gear over REST and only
//! its file id lands here — the same split as connector tokens, where credstore
//! holds the value and the connection row holds the reference. This is not just
//! taste: `FileStorageClientV1` is still a stub with one `module_name()`
//! method, so there is no in-process path to storage to take even if we wanted
//! one. When the P1 operations land upstream, nothing here has to change.
