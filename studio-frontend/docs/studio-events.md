# Studio events — how a screen is told instead of asking

The backend publishes one SSE stream per tenant, and every background run in
the assembly announces its transitions on it. A screen that needs to know when
work finished subscribes to that stream instead of re-reading
`GET /studio-tasks/v1/runs/{id}` on a timer.

The channel and its constraints are ADR-0026
([`docs/adr/0026-studio-events-push-channel.md`](../../docs/adr/0026-studio-events-push-channel.md)).

## The rule

**An operation that can outlast a request is a run.** Not a poll loop in a
screen, not a promise the tab has to stay open for: the gear that owns the work
records a `studio-tasks` run, and the portal follows it here. That is why one
vocabulary — `subject_type: task_run` — covers everything the assembly does in
the background, whichever gear is doing it:

| Task type | The long thing it owns |
|---|---|
| `artifact.ingest` | pulling a repository into the artifact graph |
| `connector.graph_sync` | a repository import |
| `session.await_ready` | waiting for a Theia session to answer |
| `spec_quality.analyze` | one detector analysis, to its verdict |
| `spec_quality.analyze_batch` | one detector over a document set |
| `notify.deliver` | a notification |
| `catalog.sync` | a component-catalogue sync |
| `session.reap`, `tasks.retention_sweep` | scheduled housekeeping |

The list grows; the vocabulary does not. If you are about to write a timer that
asks the backend whether something finished, the thing to add is a run, not a
poll.

**A run's `result` is broadcast whole.** `summary` and `last_error` are cut to
500 characters, but `result` is not capped, and every subscriber in the tenant
receives it. A handler with a large answer stores a pointer — that is why a
`spec_quality.analyze_batch` result names each document's upstream task instead
of carrying the verdicts, and why `session.await_ready` names a session rather
than its URL, which embeds a one-shot token. Read a result expecting a
reference, not always the payload.

## The service

`StudioEventsApiService` is registered on the shell in
[`src-app/app/main.tsx`](../src-app/app/main.tsx), so every MFE shares one
stream. Get it the same way as any other service:

```tsx
import { apiRegistry } from '@gears-frontx/react';
import { StudioEventsApiService } from '@/app/api';

const events = apiRegistry.getService(StudioEventsApiService);
```

It exposes four things:

| Member | What it is |
|---|---|
| `events` | the live stream, from now on |
| `streamFrom(cursor)` | the live stream, replaying everything after `cursor` first |
| `cursor` | the tenant's current high-water mark, one event at most |
| `since({ afterSeq, limit? })` | the retained window after a cursor, oldest first |

Every frame is a `StudioEvent`:

```ts
interface StudioEvent<P = unknown> {
  seq: number;          // monotonic per tenant — the resume point
  at_ms: number;
  kind: string;         // 'task.queued' | 'task.running' | 'task.progress' | 'task.succeeded' | …
  subject_type: string; // 'task_run', 'workspace', …
  subject_id: string;   // for a background run, its run id
  source: string;       // the gear that published it
  payload: P;
}
```

For `task.*` events the payload is a `StudioRunEvent`, carrying the same fields
`GET /studio-tasks/v1/runs/{id}` answers with — so one view can be fed by
either without a second mapping.

## Watch every background run

`useApiStream` connects on mount and disconnects on unmount. In the default
`'latest'` mode `data` is the most recent event:

```tsx
import { useApiStream, apiRegistry } from '@gears-frontx/react';
import { StudioEventsApiService, type StudioEvent, type StudioRunEvent } from '@/app/api';

function RunTicker() {
  const service = apiRegistry.getService(StudioEventsApiService);
  const { data, status, error } = useApiStream(service.events);

  if (status === 'connecting') return <Spinner />;
  if (status === 'error') return <StreamError error={error} />;

  const event = data as StudioEvent<StudioRunEvent> | undefined;
  if (event?.subject_type !== 'task_run') return null;

  // `subject_id` is the run id and is always there; `task_type` is not — a
  // progress frame carries only what that transition set.
  return <span>{event.subject_id.slice(0, 8)}: {event.payload.state}</span>;
}
```

The stream carries everything the assembly publishes, not only runs — always
narrow by `subject_type` (and `kind`, if you care about one transition) before
reading `payload`.

## Follow one run you just started

A task can finish before your connection is even open, and a stream opened
"from now on" will never mention it. Read the cursor **before** starting the
job and resume from it:

```tsx
function useRunProgress() {
  const service = apiRegistry.getService(StudioEventsApiService);
  const [from, setFrom] = useState<number | null>(null);
  const [runId, setRunId] = useState<string | null>(null);

  async function start() {
    // Read the mark first: everything the job publishes is then replayed,
    // however fast it finishes.
    const { latest_seq } = await service.cursor.fetch();
    setFrom(latest_seq);
    const { run_id } = await startTheJob();
    setRunId(run_id);
  }

  const { data } = useApiStream(
    from === null ? service.events : service.streamFrom(from),
    { enabled: from !== null },
  );

  const event = data as StudioEvent<StudioRunEvent> | undefined;
  const mine =
    event?.subject_type === 'task_run' && event.subject_id === runId
      ? event.payload
      : undefined;

  return { start, state: mine?.state, phase: mine?.phase };
}
```

`streamFrom` builds a distinct descriptor key per cursor, so changing the
starting point opens a fresh connection rather than reusing the old one.

A cursor of `0` is a real starting point — sequences start at 1 — so a tenant
whose first events are the job's own gets them replayed too. And `streamFrom`
does not deliver past a hole: a catch-up it cannot make, or a stream refused
with 401/403, ends it, and `onComplete` fires. For `streamFrom`, then,
`onComplete` means "cut" as well as "finished"; answer it by reading the job
once, as the editor's session does. `events`, opened without a cursor, keeps
running through a failed catch-up and logs the gap it lost.

## Refresh a list without polling

For a list, the event is a signal to reload, not the data itself. A busy run
reports progress several times a second, so coalesce:

```tsx
function useRunListRefresh(load: () => Promise<void>) {
  const service = apiRegistry.getService(StudioEventsApiService);
  const { data } = useApiStream(service.events);
  const pending = useRef<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const event = data as StudioEvent | undefined;
    if (event?.subject_type !== 'task_run') return;
    if (pending.current) return;
    pending.current = setTimeout(() => {
      pending.current = null;
      void load().catch(() => {
        /* a failed refresh keeps the last good list */
      });
    }, 300);
    return () => {
      if (pending.current) clearTimeout(pending.current);
      pending.current = null;
    };
  }, [data, load]);
}
```

The prototype's `studio-frontend-prototype/src/tasks.tsx` is the same shape
against a plain `EventSource`, and worth reading as a worked example.

## Fill a gap after the fact

`since` returns the retained window by cursor. A `latest_seq` above the last
returned `seq` means the caller fell out of that window and lost events — the
honest recovery is a full reload, not a longer replay:

```tsx
const { data } = useApiQuery(service.since({ afterSeq: lastSeen, limit: 200 }));

const lost =
  data && data.events.length > 0
    ? data.latest_seq > data.events[data.events.length - 1].seq
    : false;
```

## What the transport does for you

The shell replaces the framework's SSE transport with
[`SseAuthPlugin`](../src/api/plugins/SseAuthPlugin.ts) +
[`FetchEventSource`](../src/api/sse/FetchEventSource.ts), wired inside
`StudioEventsApiService`'s constructor. You get three things the stock
`SseProtocol` cannot give:

- **the bearer token on the connection.** The native `EventSource` can carry no
  `Authorization` header and the gateway takes no token from the query string,
  so without this an authenticated stream is simply unreachable.
- **reconnect.** `SseProtocolConfig.reconnectAttempts` is dead config; the
  retry loop lives in the transport.
- **gap-free resume.** On every reconnect the plugin replays what was published
  while the connection was down, in order, before letting a newer frame
  through.

## Traps

**Register an SSE plugin on the protocol instance.**
`BaseApiService.registerPlugin(protocol, plugin)` only records a plugin for the
framework's mock-mode toggle — it never runs. The call that works is
`sseProtocol.plugins.add(plugin)`. The TSDoc on `SseAuthPlugin` still says
`registerPlugin`; the constructor of `StudioEventsApiService` is the correct
reference.

**The server sends unnamed frames on purpose.** The framework binds only
`onmessage`, so a named event type never reaches a consumer — the kind lives
inside the JSON, in `kind`. Do not reach for
`addEventListener('task.succeeded', …)`.

**An absent field means "unchanged", not "cleared".** Events carry only what a
transition changed: `phase` rides on `task.progress`, `summary` / `error` on
the terminal ones, `result` on either — a progress report that carried counts
announces them, one that did not leaves the run's recorded result alone. Merge
into what you already hold; treating `undefined` as `null` tells a view a run
lost its counts.

**A deployment can run without the channel.** The publisher is resolved lazily,
and an absent one publishes nothing and breaks nothing — which means a screen
that only listens sits silent there. Keep a slow reload as a floor if the view
must be right without it; that is what the surviving `setInterval` in the
prototype's `tasks.tsx` is for.

**Do not confuse it with `packages/studio/src/events/studioEvents.ts`.** That
`StudioEvents` is the canvas package's own event names and has nothing to do
with this channel.

**Retries produce repeats.** `studio-tasks` retries up to five times with a
requeue between attempts, so a failing run emits running/queued pairs before
its terminal state. Drive the view from `state`, not from a count of events.
