# @constructor-studio/mfe-shared

What more than one MFE of this repository needs, in one place: the host plumbing
(theme, language, the organization in scope), the studio-connector client, and
the parser for the gears' RFC 7807 refusals.

**This is source, not a built package.** `exports` points at `src/index.ts` and
there is no `dist`: both consumers are bundlers (`moduleResolution: "bundler"`
for `tsc`, vite for the build), so each MFE compiles this code into its own
bundle. That is deliberate — a `dist` here would be one more thing that goes
stale between branches while `dev:all` rebuilds only the MFEs.

**It does not touch MFE isolation.** Nothing here is added to any MFE's
`sharedDeps`, so nothing becomes a runtime singleton: every MFE realm keeps its
own compiled copy and its own instances, exactly as it already does with
`@gears-frontx/ui-kit`. What crosses a realm boundary is still only what the
framework hands over through `globalThis` — the QueryClient and the host session.

**What belongs here:** code that is *byte-identical* in two or more MFEs. If one
MFE needs to diverge, move that piece back into it. Do not add a flag or an
option to the shared version — that is how this folder turns into a dumping
ground whose every change can break every MFE at once.

The build scripts skip this directory on purpose: `EXCLUDED_PACKAGES` in
`scripts/lib/mfe-tools.ts` holds the name `shared`, so `build:mfes` and
`dev:all` never mistake it for an MFE. `scripts/run-mfe-type-checks.mjs` does
pick it up, through the `type-check` script above.
