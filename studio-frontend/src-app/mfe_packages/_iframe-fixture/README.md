# Frame fixture

Proves `MfeHandlerIframe` without any product code: an MFE package whose entry
is a frame, built and served like every other package, mounted by the shell
into the screen area.

It is deliberately a real workspace package. A fixture assembled by hand in the
shell would prove the loader and nothing else; this one proves the whole path —
build, manifest, registry, handler, mount.

Its extension is `placement: hidden` (#318): registered and mountable, but in
no level's rail.

Its frame reads the same address property as the editor's,
`…space.mfe.frame_url.v1~`, which the shell publishes only while a project's
editor is open (#322) and clears when the project leaves scope. This fixture
is organization-level, so its frame only ever shows the frame handler's
waiting state. That proves the same path; the page's content is not what the
fixture is for.
