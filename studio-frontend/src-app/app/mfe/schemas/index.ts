  // throws, bootstrapMFE rejects, and MfeScreenContainer never renders the screen
  // slot: the rail still lists its items while every click mounts into nothing.
  extensionOverlaySchemaJson as JSONSchema,
  // One derivation further down the screen chain: the level a screen belongs to —
  // organization, workspace or project — which the rail groups by. After
  // extensionScreenSchema on purpose: a derived schema resolves its parent by
  // chain, so the type it extends has to be in the registry first, and a screen
  // extension that chains through this one fails to register otherwise.
  extensionScreenLeveledSchemaJson as JSONSchema,
  // The context-slot action an MFE executes against the screen domain. Same rule
  // as above: GTS refuses to route an action instance whose type has no schema.
  actionContextPublishSchemaJson as JSONSchema,
  // The overlay-domain counterpart: a workspace an MFE has just created, handed to
  // the shell that owns the list it belongs in.
  actionContextWorkspacesPublishSchemaJson as JSONSchema,
  // One artifact a member asked to open (#319), and the shell's echo of which one
  // the editor is on (#320). The MFE publishes, the shell owns the answer.
  actionContextArtifactOpenSchemaJson as JSONSchema,
  sharedPropertyContextArtifactSchemaJson as JSONSchema,
  // The shell -> MFE half of the same slot. `sharedProperties` on a domain and
  // `requiredProperties` on an entry both carry an `x-gts-ref` that checks the type
  // is IN THE REGISTRY, not merely that the string looks right, so an unregistered
  // id fails registration and takes bootstrapMFE with it.
  sharedPropertyContextProjectSchemaJson as JSONSchema,
  // The other two halves of the same channel: which organization the session is
  // working in, and who is signed in. Both are the shell's to know and every MFE's
  // to be told — see contextActions.ts for what they replace.
  sharedPropertyContextOrganizationSchemaJson as JSONSchema,
  // The level between them: a project's parent and the Projects list's root.

  // crossing between them.

  sharedPropertySpaceFrameUrlSchemaJson as JSONSchema,
