/**
 * App Context Slice
 *
 * What the top bar's second slot shows, and what its dropdown offers.
 *
 * The slot has two scopes. At `org` scope it names the organization the session
 * is in and switches between the user's organizations; at `project` scope it
 * names the open project and switches between projects. One slot, because the
 * mockup gives it one place — the scope decides which list is behind the
 * chevron.
 *
 * Ownership is split along the gear that owns the data, and the split is the
 * reason this slice exists rather than the shell fetching everything:
 *
 * - Organizations are account-management, which the shell already talks to
 *   (`AccountsApiService`), so the shell fills `org`/`orgs` itself.
 * - Projects are the studio-project gear, which is projects-mfe's territory.
 *   The shell never requests them; the MFE writes `project`/`projects` in by
 *   emitting `app/context/project/opened` and `app/context/projects`.
 *
 * Until projects-mfe emits those, the slot simply stays at `org` scope. That is
 * the designed resting state, not a missing feature.
 *
 * The workspace is a THIRD pair (`workspace`/`workspaces`) rather than a third
 * scope: it is in scope at the same time as the organization, while `org` and
 * `project` are alternatives to each other.
