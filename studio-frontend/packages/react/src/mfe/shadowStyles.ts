/**
 * Constructable stylesheets for shadow-root adoption.
 *
 * Styles used to reach a shadow root as DOM nodes, including the `<link>`
 * `MfeHandlerMF.injectRemoteStylesheets` appends before `mount`. Those arrive
 * strictly after the first paint of the mounted tree — a `<link>` in a
 * still-detached root does not even begin loading (measured: nothing after 300ms
 * detached, 18ms once attached). So first paint was unstyled: a flash on every
 * mount, a jump in the overlay whose card shrink-wraps content that late CSS
 * sizes.
 *
 * The fix is a cache that is already warm by the time anyone mounts, not a
 * mount that waits. `prewarmShadowStyles` fetches every sheet at bootstrap, from
 * URLs the MFE manifest carries long before a click; `warmShadowStyles` then
 * reads them back **synchronously**, so `mount` adopts everything before its
 * first render without introducing an await. A cold read returns `null` and the
 * caller takes the old DOM-node path for that one mount — slower, never blank,
 * and warm by the next one.
 *
 * @packageDocumentation

 * Adoption is all-or-nothing, and that is a cascade fact: adopted sheets rank
 * after a root's own `styleSheets` whatever the insertion order, so moving only
 * some of them would silently re-rank the rest — the shell's Tailwind would start
 * beating the ui-kit theme. A runtime without constructed sheets therefore keeps
 * the DOM-node path for all of them. jsdom 26 is that runtime, which is why the
 * fallback is what vitest exercises.

 * so a relative `url()` would resolve against the document and `@import` is
 * dropped by `replaceSync` outright. Neither is guarded here. No sheet in this
 * repo has either — the only `url()`s are the shell's root-relative `@font-face`
 * srcs, which resolve identically with or without a base and are inert in a
 * shadow root anyway. Guarding it meant ~30 lines of regex that, on today's
 * input, rewrote 19 tokens into themselves.
